# PROJECT
OAI AKOA knee lateral classification
## PROJECT OVERVIEW
The lateral classification of the OAI AKOA knee dataset(left or right sided knee) with a minimum accuracy of 90%.
## DEPENDENCIES
* Python 3.7
* TensorFlow 2.3
* Numpy
* sklearn.model_selection
  * train_test_split
* PIL
  * Image
## ALGORITHM
The model is a convolutional neural network that consists of one 2d convolutional layer and dense layers on the top to perform the classification. A convolutional neural network is a deep learning algorithm that takes in an input shape and is able to differentiate it from another image.
